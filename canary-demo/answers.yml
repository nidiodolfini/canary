# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: The Prometheus instance was not scraping metrics from the application deployments.
  suggested_improvements: I added the label "release: prometheus" to the ServiceMonitor so that Prometheus could discover and scrape the targets properly.
